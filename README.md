# React â€“ des Kaisers immer neuere Kleider

This repository contains 3 different folders to demonstrate the switch from class to functional components in react.

The sample application is about personnel planning, which means assigning shifts to employees.

Data is generated randomly and stored in local storage.

## Demonstration steps:

In folder `personnel-planning-react-classes`

1. Explain and go through the sample application built with class components (state, props, lifecycle method componentDidMount)
2. Show how to share stateful logic between class components

In folder `personnel-planning-react-functions`

1. Create same class components as functional components (with some errors)
2. Fix and explain live errors
3. Extract stateful logic into custom hook and share between components
