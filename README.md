# React â€“ des Kaisers immer neuere Kleider

This repository contains 3 different folders to demonstrate the switch from class to functional components in react.

The sample application is about personnel planning, which means assigning shifts to employees.

Data is generated randomly and stored in local storage.

## Demonstration steps

This repository contains several subfolders with different implementations of the sample components.

1. In folder `src/classComponents`: Explain and go through the sample application built with class components (state, props, lifecycle method componentDidMount)

2. Show how to share stateful logic between class components with higher order component

3. Split screen vscode and try to write the employee list as functional component (explain, debug and try to fix it)

4. Create custom hook to extract state logic from list and use it also for shift list
